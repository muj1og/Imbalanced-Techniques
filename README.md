# Imbalanced-Data
I chose this datasets to work with because imbalanced-data really challanging to work with
and at the same time to boost my knowldge and skills as a data scentist and push my computer 
hardware to the limits.

In real life imbalanced datasets can be found in many senario for example- fraud detection, cancer detection, manfacturing defects, online ads conversion etc.
